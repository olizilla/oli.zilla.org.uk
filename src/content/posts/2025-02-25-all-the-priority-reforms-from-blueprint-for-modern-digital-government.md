## Method

I scraped and transformed the nicely structured HTML from https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-blueprint-for-modern-digital-government/a-blueprint-for-modern-digital-government-html by running the following in the browser console on that page

```js
$$('[id^=priority-reforms]').map(x => {
  const url = `${window.location}#${x.id}`
  const items = document.querySelectorAll(`[id=${x.id}]~ul li`)
  return [...items].map(i => `<li><a href=${url}>${i.innerHTML}</a></li>`).join('')
}).join('')
```

and pasting the output into an `<ol>`

## What's next

When I get time I'll turn this into a dashboard where we can track the progress on each one.

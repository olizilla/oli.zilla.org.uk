			Why the <abbr class="no-underline" title="Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose">IIPP</abbr>?
		</h2>
		<p class="text-lg">
			<strong>I believe in the mission</strong>: We need a network of people with the skills and motivation to rebuild trust: between citizens and the state; locals and local government.
		</p>
		<p class="pt-4 text-lg">
			During lockdown I read 
			<a class="hover:text-blue-600 font-bold" href="https://marianamazzucato.com/books/the-value-of-everything/">"The Value of Everything"</a> and it demystified the mess we're in with a broad and compelling vision of what 'better' looks like. Then 
			<a class="hover:text-blue-600 font-bold" href="https://www.hilarycottam.com/radical-help/">"Radical Help"</a> demonstrated how projects rooted in listening to those effected can start to repair the damage. I've been following the IIPP ever since.<a href="#note-1" class="hover:text-blue-600"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
		</p>
		<p class="pt-4 text-lg">
			I'm deep into a career building software; an industry where it has become normal to roll out innovations without considering those who will be impacted, or taking responsibility for outcomes not shown on the balance sheet.
		</p>
		<p class="pt-4 text-lg">
			I've participated in scrappy co-operatives that succeeded by listening and co-creating together 
			(<a class="hover:text-blue-600" href="https://tableflip.io">TABLEFLIP</a>, 
			<a class="hover:text-blue-600" href="https://outlandish.com/">Outlandish</a>,
			<a class="hover:text-blue-600" href="https://www.coops.tech/">Co-Tech</a>). 
			And I've worked on well-funded and well-intentioned projects that derailed through misalignment and poor communication.
		</p>
		<p class="pt-4 text-lg">
			The most poorly functioning systems I've seen were always a reflection of the behaviours and priorities that created them. Debugging the code never fixed the team. I want to step back from solving the symptoms and learn how to incubate healthy collaborations that grow and fill the gaps in practical and humane ways.
		</p>
		<p class="pt-4 text-lg">
			I want to be part of the conversations the IIPP is nurturing. I want to pivot and acknowledge that while I have experience, I am a beginner here. I want to put my energy in to working on real and immediate social problems and supporting those that see those issues more clearly than I do.

			<p class="pt-4">
				People say to me: <em>"Why have you decided to work with local councils? That seems so boring. What are you doing?"</em>
			</p>
			<p class="pt-4">
				There is something very attractive about the boring problems... the classic local council thing: "what are we doing about the bins?" that is the real life reality of people. It's not Elon Musk's next moonshot... I started life as a scientist and in technology... the problems I am working on now are so much more exciting.
			</p>
			<p class="pt-4 pb-4">
				I'd love to see a real recruitment drive of all the talent that goes in to silicon valley and technology. Let's get that talent into civic problems. Lets get them working with local councils; into the boroughs with communities. That is where the work really lies for the next decade.
			</p>
		</Quote>
		<p class="text-lg">
			I'm down for that. If <em>the bins</em> are the battle ground, hand me the gloves!
		</p>

		<h2 class="text-xl pt-8 font-bold">
			Why me?
		</h2>
		<p class="pt-4 text-lg">
			I build, maintain, comprehend, and untangle complex systems.
			I love nuance and language, enthusiasm, care, solidarity, and people.
		</p>
		<p class="pt-4 text-lg">
			I want to use my energy with and for purpose. I'm going to give my time to listening, facilitating, growing and celebrating communities.
		</p>
		<p class="pt-4 ">
			...and more prosaically I have:
		</p>
		<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
			<li class="pt-4">
				Designed, built, and maintained hundreds of software systems, some with millions of users. 
				(<a class="hover:text-blue-600" href="https://docs.ipfs.io">IPFS</a>,
				<a class="hover:text-blue-600" href="https://protocol.ai">Protocol Labs</a>)
			</li>
			<li class="pt-2">
				Run a software development agency as a co-operative 
				(<a class="hover:text-blue-600" href="https://tableflip.io">TABLEFLIP</a>), that guided its customers to give back to the commons of open-source, collaborated with other co-ops 
				(<a class="hover:text-blue-600" href="https://www.coops.tech/">Co-Tech</a>), and used its profits to buy time to share knowledge and build community through local meet-ups.
			</li>
			<li class="pt-2">
				Run a local lunch club where all the participants take turns to cook for each other, facilitated by a small app that simply tracks and visualises the number of lunches eaten vs given, to diffuse the complicated issue of "whose turn is it to cook!?". (<em>This worked without argument for 5 years and over 100+ hungry fabricators</em>)
			</li>
			<li class="pt-2">
				Helped set up the West Norwood Feast, a monthly volunteer powered street market that aimed to get folks to know their neighbours and boost the local high street. It's in its 11th year!

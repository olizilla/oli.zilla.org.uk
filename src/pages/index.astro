				Social scientists have a word for labels like addiction: they call it an “<b>empty signifier</b>”, bearing no specific meaning beyond what's been imposed on to it.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Folks can have a mutually intelligible conversation about 'addiction' and believe they're talking about the same thing,” said Jennifer Carroll, a medical anthropologist at North Carolina State University, "and they're really not."

				The next step will require great humility, since we are now so prone to confuse great building projects with great social achievements. 
				We will have to admit that it is beyond the scope of anyone's imagination to create community.
				We must learn to cherish the communities we have, they are hard to come by.

				'Fix the buildings, but leave the people.' 'No relocation outside the neighborhood.' These must be the slogans if public housing is to be popular.

				When political economy was split up into political philosophy and economic science in the late nineteenth century, it opened up what the philosopher Michael Sandel has called a ‘moral vacancy’ at the heart of public policymaking. 
			</p>
			<p class="pb-3 text-lg">
				Today economists and politicians debate with confident ease in the name of economic efficiency, productivity and growth – as if those values were self-explanatory – while hesitating to speak of justice, fairness and rights. 
			</p>
			<p class="text-lg">
				Talking about values and goals is a lost art waiting to be revived.
